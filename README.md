# bg3_randomjoinsound
A SourceMod plugin for Battle Grounds III that plays a predefined sound to the player upon joining the server.

Plugin will also work for other SourceMod compatible games.


Installation:
(On the server system)
Place randomjoinsound.smx in /bg3/addons/sourcemod/plugins
Place music clips in /bg3sound/66thserversounds

Do any FastDL stuff needed.

Right now the song choice and folder in which they are stored is hardcoded.
If you need/want to, change the corresponding file paths in the code, and compile the .sp file again.

TODO:
Allow for custom choice of music folder + adding new songs
